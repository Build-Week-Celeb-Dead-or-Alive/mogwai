        <h2>What's this game?</h2>
        <p>Designed to be the ultimate combination of speed and brains, Celebrity Dead or Alive challenges you and your friends' decades' worth of TV trivia to see just how you've kept up with the lives of celebrities beyond the silver screen.</p>
        <p>This game is perfect if there's a self-professed hiphop or TV head (every group has one!). Tell them it's time to put their money where their mouth is on Celebrity Dead or Alive!</p>

            <h2>Scoring System</h2>
            <p>Whenever you answer correctly whether a celebrity is dead or alive, you win a point. You get another point - not tracked, but equally awesome for bragging rights - if you can guess the year they died - if they died.</p>
            <p>The game also awards points to the fastest fingers on group mode, so you have to be both correct AND fast!</p>
            <p>Each round of the game lasts 1 minute 30 seconds. That's 90 seconds of becoming confronted by your sparse knowledge of celebrities and the lives - or deaths! - they lead.</p>
